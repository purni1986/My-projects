I have worked on the following data analysis projects.
1. Sepsis Data analysis
Worked on data visualization of sepsis patients data in tableau to create meaningful insigts based on the demography of sepsis patients, biomarkers which are very important to be analysed,
organs which are affected in sepsis patients, SIRS(Systemic inflamatory response syndrome), septic shock analysis, SOFA scores and apache scores. This was an extensive analysis of data where we created 
insigtful data analysis which gives inportant insights to health care professionals to give suitable care for sepsis patients. Here is our final dashboard.

2. SQL Hackathon Oct 2025
I was very fortunate to have participated in the SQL Hackathon Oct 2025 conducted by Numpy Ninja. Here I was a given a raw data of glucose variability index data of patients.
https://physionet.org/content/big-ideas-glycemic-wearable/1.1.2/
This data gives the glucose measurements, the EDA values, IBI values and the heart rate measurements of 16 patients who wore those devices.First I cleaned and transformed the data,created the ERD for the tables,
analysed the data through SQL queries which used window functions, stored procedures, functions, triggers, CTE's and other SQL techniques to give meaningful insights.
