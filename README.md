I have worked on the following data analysis projects.
1. Sepsis Data analysis
Worked on data visualization of sepsis patients data in tableau to create meaningful insigts based on the demography of sepsis patients, biomarkers which are very important to be analysed,
organs which are affected in sepsis patients, SIRS(Systemic inflamatory response syndrome), septic shock analysis, SOFA scores and apache scores. This was an extensive analysis of data where we created 
insigtful data analysis which gives inportant insights to health care professionals to give suitable care for sepsis patients. Here is our final dashboard.

2. SQL Hackathon Oct 2025
I was very fortunate to have participated in the SQL Hackathon Oct 2025 conducted by Numpy Ninja. Here I was a given a raw data of glucose variability index data of patients.
https://physionet.org/content/big-ideas-glycemic-wearable/1.1.2/
This data gives the glucose measurements, the EDA values, IBI values and the heart rate measurements of 16 patients who wore those devices.First I cleaned and transformed the data,created the ERD for the tables,
analysed the data through SQL queries which used window functions, stored procedures, functions, triggers, CTE's and other SQL techniques to give meaningful insights. 

3. Datathon Nov 2025
I was very fortunate to have participated in the Datathon Nov 2025 challenge conducted by Numpy Ninja. Here I was given the GLAM (Glucose Monitoring across Maternity) data from Jaeb centre for research
•	Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards for healthcare data as part of a Datathon challenge.
•	Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power BI (Sprint 1) using Power Query to prepare patient datasets for analysis
•	Conducted in-depth analysis of Medical History of patients,maternal and fetal health, glucose and blood pressure trends, PCOS prevalence, and post-delivery outcomes.
•	Built visual insights on demographics, comorbidities, and health indicators to identify patterns influencing maternal and fetal well-being.
•	Delivered a data-driven summary of critical health parameters improving interpretability of clinical datasets for decision-making.

4. Clinical Analytics Project – Cerebromicrovascular Disease in Elderly with Diabetes- Dec 2025
Power BI | DAX | Clinical Biomarker Analysis

 •	Built an end-to-end clinical analytics dashboard in Power BI focusing on cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD/cMVD) in elderly patients with diabetes.
 •	Modeled and visualized multidomain clinical data: glucose & lipid profiles, inflammatory and immune biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-α, sICAM, sVCAM), BBB integrity markers (MMPs), blood pressure trends,  ophthalmological findings, and walking test outcomes.
 •	Developed custom DAX measures for patient-level risk stratification, visit-wise trends, biomarker normalization (z-scores), and subgroup analysis (diabetes, hypertension, smoking status).
 •	Enabled clinically interpretable insights through slicers, page navigation, and biomarker-specific visuals to support hypothesis-driven exploration of microvascular brain injury.
